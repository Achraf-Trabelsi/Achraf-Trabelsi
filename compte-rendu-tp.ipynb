       "['One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just Oz episode you ll be hooked They are right as this is exactly what happened with me The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word GO Trust me this is not show for the faint hearted or timid This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence Its is hardcore in the classic use of the word It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary It focuses mainly on Emerald City an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda Em City is home to many Aryans Muslims gangstas Latinos Christians Italians Irish and more so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn dare Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance OZ doesn mess around The first episode ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal couldn say was ready for it but as watched more developed taste for Oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence Not just violence but injustice crooked guards who ll be sold out for nickel inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience Watching Oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing thats if you can get in touch with your darker side ',\n",
       " 'A wonderful little production The filming technique is very unassuming very old time BBC fashion and gives comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece The actors are extremely well chosen Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is terrificly written and performed piece masterful production about one of the great master of comedy and his life The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with Halliwell murals decorating every surface are terribly well done ',\n",
       " 'I thought this was wonderful way to spend time on too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching light hearted comedy The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point Risk Addiction thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love This was the most d laughed at one of Woody comedies in years dare say decade While ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into average but spirited young woman This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman great comedy to go see with friends ',\n",
       " 'Basically there a family where little boy Jake thinks there a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time This movie is slower than soap opera and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie OK first of all when you re going to make film you must Decide if its thriller or drama As drama the movie is watchable Parents are divorcing arguing like in real life And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film expected to see BOOGEYMAN similar movie and instead watched drama with some meaningless thriller spots out of just for the well playing parents descent dialogs As for the shots with Jake just ignore them ',\n",
       " 'Petter Mattei Love in the Time of Money is visually stunning film to watch Mr Mattei offers us vivid portrait about human relations This is movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter This being variation on the Arthur Schnitzler play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact Stylishly the film has sophisticated luxurious look We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter The acting is good under Mr Mattei direction Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive We wish Mr Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work ',\n",

minded rebellious female character in period drama knew was in for something to make me want to kill myself Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing rooms but sort of certificate Wuthering Heights Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain Not to mention that Jane Austen and in particular P is not about passion sexual tension or love It about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society Which was completely ignored so that the Bennets house was rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from Matrix Reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances It was so obviously trying to be serious film The humour which IS Pride Prejudice both Austen methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily Pride Prejudice is serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it You can lose Jane Austen technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is tragic heroine Elizabeth wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with what lot of giggling and staring into the distance Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits And where the great strength of Austen Elizabeth at least in Austen eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety Knightley Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention Furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance In which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic His special bond with Lizzie as the only two sensible people in world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in modern day romantic comedy Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache ',\n",

whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it But we re all different Made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting Some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that the way you have to be to live among the masses Who knows Who knows what it takes to make things life work Writer director Lisa Krueger takes shot at it using light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in Committed starring Heather Graham as young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just little bit crazy too Her name is Joline and this is her story Admittedly Joline has always been committed person in work relationships in life in general She a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what And when she marries Carl Luke Wilson it forever The only problem is someone forgot to tell Carl and days into the marriage he gone off to find himself and figure it all out When Joline realizes he not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage Maybe it because of that clay she made of Regardless she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him which she does in El Paso Texas of all places But once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know she there She considers Carl as being in spiritual coma and it her job to keep spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses And while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters young woman named Carmen Patricia Velazquez waitress at one of the local eateries Carmen Grampy Alfonso Arau who is something of mystic Bo Mark Ruffalo truck driver who has issues concerning Carl and Neil Goran Visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes fancy to her For Joline it a journey of discovery during which she learns lot about Carl but even more about herself There a touch of humor touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot And Krueger presents it all extremely well delivering film that is engaging and entertaining Her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story We see it from Joline point of view as Krueger makes us privy to Joline thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts decided perspective on the events as they unfold That along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for very effective piece of storytelling There an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters And the result is well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline character totally of her own creation She immerses herself in the part and gives performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between portrayal that is mere representation of person and one that is real And for this film to work it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable and Graham succeeds on all fronts Her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it all part of the character she creates there an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out She a likable agreeable person and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is It a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life As Carmen Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging as well Her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character She has charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth She is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal And as with Joline this character is well written and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life Overall there is number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of Luke Wilson Casey Affleck as Joline brother Jay Goran Visnjic Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as Bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create memorable character The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens Jenny Clea Du Vall Mimi Summer Phoenix Meg Art Alexakis New York Car Thief Dylan Baker Carl Editor and Mary Kay Place Psychiatrist film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture reflecting upon who we are where we re going and what we really need Committed is an enjoyable experience ride definitely worth taking ',\n",

personal identity The ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of gut check on the one hand or complete escape from self on the other Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim But what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director Zhang Yang and his actors bring to this journey No clich no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims Hongshen Jia is in his mid twenties He a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved The perfect recipe for his enablers Soon he the cool actor idolized by youth He was hot in the early nineties He always had to be the most fashionable He needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and scarf His acting means the arts friends and roles But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input And his self criticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred didn know how to act felt like phony and to readily available drugs to counter them He says had to get high to do what director wanted So his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity Hongshen disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittent and doggedly his own Solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy The abstract is out

the while picking up cues to more real and realistic identity started to open up he says of this period in retrospect And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects kind of dancer positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in current circumstance If mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to new identity he smashes his videos and TV and bangs his head till bloody against his John Lennon Forever poster He has let down his iconic anti establishment artist but he the only viable guide he knows He even imagines himself as John son Yoko Ono and adopts his Mother Mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals Music is so much more real than acting he says And speaks of Lennon influence as showing me new way In the mental institute the life saving apples resistance nourishment reflect Lennon presence as does Hongshen need to re hang his hero poster in his redecorated room If Lennon influence is spiriting Hongshen father influence is grounding Although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is Fegsen differences from his son that underwrites his change For the father is more secure in himself he accepts that he Chinese peasant in line of peasants rural theater director And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions It this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans Beatles and passivity In his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being liar and fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts acted before were bullshit life is bullshit And to Hongshen emphatic you are NOT my father he softly replies why can a peasant be your father Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to real not whole self As the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity Indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust Integrity banishes his black cloud All his edges soften You are just human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine Back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now And his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant

       " 'Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format So when saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews Blake Edwards opus decided to purchase and watch it once and for all Boy what terrible film It so bad and on so many levels that really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong Looking at it now it obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc because Hollywood thought she wasn sexy or glamorous enough So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is Some specific scenes are good or effective but as whole it just doesn work at all to point of it being very embarrassing Mind you the version on the DVD is the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop In releasing the DVD Edwards cut scenes from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version The film moves along with no idea of what it is We are minutes into it and we still don know what going on or why we re watching what going What kind of spy is Lili How powerful is she Was she ever responsible for someone death Instead we watch thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews Things aren helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love Why does Julie fall for Hudson Why him and not other men she got involved with There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings There no catalyst in this story One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews and Edwards previous successes The best or worst example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows group of children who sing in the middle of forest Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC It no wonder he removed it from the DVD Back in that scene might have worked on certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews Edwards other films The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE The musical moment ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julie MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing striptease in the act The ending bird eye view of Julie running towards Hudson plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSIC The whole thing is confusing Julie plays singer born from German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her English songs in Paris You never know exactly where the story takes place Some moments are just badly edited Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence m like what happened here The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy Every scene with the French police are pathetic Where Peter Sellers when you really need him The action is stupid beyond belief When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudson squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process Brilliant What also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning That one slow moving train there The musical moments The beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason gave this film stars but it effect is diminished considerably because it repeated at the end Speaking of redundant did we really need to see can can dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too The Girl in no man land is OK even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to group of injured soldiers at French hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying The whole project is listless and without energy The romance is unbelievable Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene Julie looks dazed like she on Valium But what really kills this ill conceived project is Julie playing German spy Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing traitor was good career decision As much as like Julie she no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI Funny enough even if Julie plays German spy she still comes across as cloying and cute How bad is DARLING LILI Even after years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release

       " 'In director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their Silly Symphonies series The Skeleton Dance Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early in Disney Laugh Gram cartoon series however their friendship suffered tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio That was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of Flip the Frog While his work kept the same high quality it wasn really popular and by the studio was closed Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color Skeleton Frolics is essentially remake of the classic The Skeleton Dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune Like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play The dead rise from their coffins ready for the show that about to begin as group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play happy tune Now it not easy to be musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it hard to dance with loose body parts Everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by The Skeleton Dance years before although with crucial difference Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before It is certainly more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance although sadly this doesn mean it necessarily better film For starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects It looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all However it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all Iwerks executes it in wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl Stalling for The Skeleton Dance In other words while DeNat tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling song has unique personality that makes it unforgettable Being musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk flawless work of animation Personally think that with better musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remembered as fondly as The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it still fun film to watch It kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer Disney main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films It was probably just case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disney mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney Despite its shortcomings Skeleton Frolics is very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can help but thinking of The Skeleton Dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that Iwerk skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us ',\n",

       " 'Such joyous world has been created for us in Pixar A Bug Life we re immersed in universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely universe which could only be documented through the world of animation For those who have forgotten what plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when it in the right hands that is Bug Life is warm reminder We walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions It is only Pixar second animated feature The sub group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in with their landmark movie Toy Story It was movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined whole new level of excellence Now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film After all it a film about ants Well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in Bug Life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of movie let alone provide the entire premise of feature film Surely they jest However we forget that in Toy Story bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you ll probably ever encounter Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isn an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters but they re colourful they re eclectic and they re idiosyncratic And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto Bug Life from the beginning We shall start with our main character and our hero His name is Flik David Foley and his character is rather generic to say the least Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful Ant Island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season harvest with his antics The problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper Kevin Spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of better term Hopper offers proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack hands however it a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil The cogs and clockwork in Flik mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers If you think about it Bug Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line of Akira Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai or the American remake The Magnificent Seven in which village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil In Bug Life the help comes in the form of down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in bar room brawl Much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs Among them are an erudite stick insect David Hyde Pierce side splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and quasi femme fatale ladybug who in fact gritty and masculine ladybug Dennis Hopper It exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively As ve said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall dazzling movie What makes Bug Life even better is that the film isn restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clich kid friendly situations are bit more abundant than we like However it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film Although Bug Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still superb movie and the start of something promising here Pixar have proved that they re not just one hit wonder but instead much gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood They raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it only always by themselves What more is there to say about Bug Life other than see it it not quite the best which we ve seen from the folks at Emeryville California but this beats out the lot of its year and ll be damned if this isn the best

       " 'I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie personally like the Empire Strikes Back lot also but think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower moving was not as episodic and just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as did with the third movie It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as whole have heard many strange reasons such as Because Yoda died Because Bobba Fett died Because small Ewoks defeated band of stormtroopers Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because believe that they miss the point completely First off WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die Don get me wrong am fan of Bobba Fett but he made few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas intention to make him central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett name Judging ROTJ because minor character died is bit much think Secondly many fans did not like Yoda dying Sure it was momentous period in the movie was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic All the good guys can stay alive in realistic movie you know Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to cheesy Saturday morning cartoon Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda death Well nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in New Hope Many consider New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy Why was Obi Wan death okay but Yoda not hmmmmmmmmmmmm Another reason just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible That is utterly ridiculous can not believe this one First off the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage Since you lived in the forest all your life hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage They had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest The only thing they had was their blasters To add it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated combination of the Star Wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been great upset Lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you How about in Empire Strikes Back or in New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of group consisting of just Han Solo Chewbacca and the Princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view And not only that the heroes of course always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters The troopers must have VERY VERY bad aim then At least in Empire Strikes Back the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against legion of stormtroopers Don believe me Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando base Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at somehow they missed as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star The last reason that care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed Well in many ways that was major part of the plot in the movie Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father Annakin Skywalker It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father face because it made it complete By Annakin revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker by removing the helmet The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about In fact that is what would have done in that scene too if were Luke father Isn that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in mechanized helmet On another note think subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves never go into film with that deception in mind always try to go into film with the attitude that Well it might be better or worse that the original But can not know for sure Let see That way go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that clearly superior film is not as good as it really was am not sure who criticizes these movies but have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that New Hope was their favorite that it is ROTJ believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading Bottom line the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its minutes There was not moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above For example the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day Finally hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as This movie stinks because Luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately ',\n",

       " 'This movie basically is very well made production and gives good impression of war situation and its effects on those involved It always interesting to see the story from the other side for change This movie concentrates on group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad Russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought It interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the villains In this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you re fighting against At first it kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German are the evil villains But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them The way this story is told isn however the best It hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other The movie isn always logic in its storytelling and features bit too many sequences that remain too vague It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who It doesn always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasn even shot in Russia itself It helps to create good war time situation atmosphere The character are mostly interesting although perhaps tad bit formulaic But don know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism It also helps that they re being played by well cast actors All of the actors aren the best known actors around Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth look due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values ',\n",

etc Now this movie holds special place in my heart already despite me being only years old at the time of writing this review because of my style early Childhood watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville Simon Seville Theodore Seville and David Seville David the Chipmunk adoptive father is in rush to get to the airport as he is going on business trip around Europe His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack While they are talking Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world Even though technically Dave is only going to Europe so to Alvin apparently only America and Europe qualify as The World David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller much to the displeasure of the boys Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller Later at local Caf the Chipmunks are playing game of Around the World in days against the Chipettes Brittany Jeanette and Eleanore After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by crocodile Alvin get in an argument with Brittany about who would really win race around the world Two diamond smugglers sitting at nearby table Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and needing safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them They set up race around the world where each team will have to deposit doll in their own likeness Secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive doll in the opposing team likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there The winning team would then receive dollar reward They do this because they believe that Jamal An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids However this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally And so begins great adventure This film is classic and see no reason why anyone would not like it It features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the Kick ass music Pardon my french My favorite song is without shred of doubt The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll An amazing rock song that cannot be topped It also my favorite moment in the film Other notable songs include Getting Lucky Kind of Suggestive for kid film eh and My Mother as well as Wooly Bully and Off to see the world Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra The scene with My mother still brings tear to my eye In relation to the song Getting Lucky first didn think anything of it but when grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was little bit suggestive That song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince men when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child Anyway bit after that scene the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr know the characters better than anyone They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon as well as Dave and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses Nancy Cartwright The voice of Bart Simpson makes an appearance in this movie She plays the part of the Arabian Prince very small but important role The ending is of course happy one The Crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset Alvin complaining about not having gotten his dollar reward for winning the race which annoys Dave until he finally yells ALVIN and the screen fades to blackClassic ending by the way hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven seen this flick give it watch It worth the money This Nostalgic classic from the gets solid out of Headin for the top Don you know we never stop believing

       " 'This is like zoology textbook given that its depiction of animals is so accurate However here are few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film Handgun bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons It doesn matter how many times you shoot at the Komodo bullets just won go near it The best way to avoid being eaten by giant Cobra or giant Komodo dragon is just to stand there The exception to this rule is if you ve been told to stay very still in which case you should run off until the Komodo is right next to you and then you should stand there expecting defeat Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching is memory enhancement tool and an ample substitute for losing your boating license getting arrested Members of elite army units don see giant Komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over sized beings Maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it When filming news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing reporter and cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need sound gear second camera microphones etc are all superfluous When you hear loud animal scream and one person has gun he should take it out and point it at the nearest person When you take gun out the sound of the safety being taken off will be made even if your finger is nowhere near the safety Reporters agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something without having the faintest idea what they re exposing Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism Handguns hold at least bullets in one clip and then more than that in the next clip Despite that those with guns claim that they will need more ammo Expensive cameras also remember that the reporter only has one camera are regularly left behind without even moment hesitation or regret These cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves The blonde girl really is the stupid one The same girl that says not to go into house because Komodo dragon can easily run right through it thus making it unsafe takes team into building made of the same material for protection and nobody says word about it High tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to feet long in matter of day but don grow at all in the weeks either side The military routinely destroys entire islands when people don meet contact deadlines Men with guns don necessarily change the direction they re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them Instead they just keep shooting into the air The better looking you are the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures Women intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds Any time you re being hunted by giant creatures is great time to hit on girls half your age Animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for swearing at the same volume Old Israeli and Russian planes are regularly used by the US Military ',\n",
